# pico-sys

> Bindings to the PicoHTTPParser.

## errantmind fork

I forked to enable compilation with sse4.2 and a couple of other optimizations. I also added a 'proper' submodule for `picohttpparser`

## Usage

Use the crates.io repository; add this to your `Cargo.toml` along
with the rest of your dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
pico-sys = "*"
```
